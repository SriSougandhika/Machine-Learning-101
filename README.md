# 🤖 Machine Learning 101
Welcome to my Machine Learning 101 project! 🎯 This repo is a beginner-friendly introduction to some core machine learning algorithms. I implemented both regression and classification models using simple real-world datasets.

## What’s Inside?
This project covers the basics of supervised learning using two popular algorithms:

📍 **1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- KNN Classifier: Classifies data points by looking at the majority class among its closest neighbors.
- KNN Regressor: Predicts numeric values by averaging the values of nearby data points.

📍 **2. Linear Regression**
- Simple Linear Regression: Predicts salary based on years of experience using the Salary_data.csv dataset. One input feature ➡️ One output.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Predicts company profit based on R&D, marketing, and administration costs using 50_Startups.csv. Multiple inputs ➡️ One output.

📍 **Some more algorithms coming up!**

## Requirements
Make sure to have these:
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn
